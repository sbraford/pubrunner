# Pubrunner

Do publishing androids dream of electric sheep?

Pubrunner is a command-line tool and library that converts simple text files (e.g. novels) into distributable formats: Kindle, HTML, PDF, and Octopress.

Pubrunner uses a simplified version of Markdown, called Pubdown. Pubdown allows basic formatting, such as **bold**, *italics* and most importantly, tab-indentation aware publishing.
